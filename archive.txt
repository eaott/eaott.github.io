      I'm a sixth year statistics doctoral candidate at UT-Austin in Sinead Williamson's lab.
      My interests are primarily in Bayesian deep learning, applying approximate Bayesian inference
      methods to neural networks. Specifically, I'm working on extending
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05336" target="_blank">Probabilistic Backpropagation</a> and
      investigating a Bayesian interpretation of transfer learning. Additionally, I'm working on sparse graph neural network methods.
      <!--As a second-year statistics doctoral student at UT-Austin, I'm
      still exploring my potential research interests. Some of the SDS seminar
      talks I've found most interesting were Babak Shahbaba's talk on
      "<a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/events/icalrepeat.detail/2015/10/16/121/-/sds-seminar-series-babak-shahbaba" target="_blank">Scalable Monte Carlo Methods</a>"
      and Veronika Rockova's talk on "<a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/events/icalrepeat.detail/2016/01/29/129/-/sds-seminar-series-veronika-rockova" target="_blank">Fast Bayesian Factor Analysis via Automatic Rotations to Sparsity</a>."
      Although it is a somewhat old-hat in its simplest form, I've found Hamiltonian (or hybrid) Monte Carlo absolutely fascinating,
      as it connected so well with what I learned as a physics major.

      Additionally, I found Aws Albarghouthi's talk on "Proving that Programs Do
      Not Discriminate" at the <a href="http://cpcp.wisc.edu/outreach/privacy-symposium-fall-2016" target="_blank">Big Privacy: Policy
      Meets Data Science Symposium</a> to be very intriguing. With an increased reliance
      on automated decision making (often using machine learning), it's important
      to understand whether programs discriminate, how to detect it, and so on.-->

      From Fall 2016-Summer 2018 and Fall 2020-present, I have been very fortunate to be an NIH Biomedical Big Data Science Fellow
      through a T32 grant at UT as part of the <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/bd2k" target="_blank">BD2K (Big Data to Knowledge)</a> initiative.
      I have participated in research rotations in Alex Huk's lab in neuroscience, analyzing electrophysiological data
      from a novel visual stimulus.
